# Spotify Discover Weekly Playlist Saver

This is a simple Node.js application that allows users to save songs from their "Discover Weekly" playlist on Spotify to a custom "Saved Weekly" playlist. The app uses the Spotify Web API for authentication and playlist management.

## Features

- Authenticate with Spotify
- Access the user's "Discover Weekly" playlist
- Save tracks from "Discover Weekly" to a new or existing "Saved Weekly" playlist

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A Spotify Developer account and an application set up on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dantecodex/spotify-discover-weekly-saver.git
   cd spotify-discover-weekly-saver
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Spotify app credentials:

   ```plaintext
   CLIENTID=your_spotify_client_id
   CLIENTSECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   SECRET=your_session_secret
   ```

   - `CLIENTID`: Your Spotify application client ID
   - `CLIENTSECRET`: Your Spotify application client secret
   - `SECRET`: A secret key for session management (can be any string)

4. **Set up the Redirect URI in Spotify Dashboard:**

   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
   - Select your application.
   - In the application settings, find the "Redirect URIs" section.
   - Add the following URI:

     ```
     http://localhost:8888/redirect
     ```

   - Make sure to save your changes.

5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will start on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

6. **Authenticate with Spotify:**

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). You will be redirected to Spotify for authentication. After logging in, you will be redirected back to the application.

## Usage

Once authenticated, the application will retrieve your "Discover Weekly" playlist and save its tracks to a "Saved Weekly" playlist. If the "Saved Weekly" playlist does not exist, it will be created.

## Dependencies

- `express`: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- `express-session`: Simple session middleware for Express
- `spotify-web-api-node`: A Node.js wrapper for the Spotify Web API
